Quaint Privacy License (with Building in Public)

This software is like a rare butterfly – unique and meant just for my personal portfolio website. Please don't flutter it around without asking me first.

No copying, remixing, or selling allowed! It's like trying to take a bite out of someone else's birthday cake – just not cool. You can't just waltz in and copy, modify, publish, sell, or distribute this software like it's free candy. It's more like a secret recipe guarded by a quirky chef with a penchant for privacy.

I'm keeping all the copyright stuff locked up tighter than a treasure chest. This software is my baby, and I'm not sharing custody. I'm hanging onto all the copyright goodies, so don't even think about swiping them. This software is my brainchild, and I'm not about to let it roam free like a wild Pokémon.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH ALL THE QUIRKS AND WHIMSY OF A MAD SCIENTIST'S LAB. I'M NOT LIABLE FOR ANY hiccups, BUMPS, OR STRANGE ENCOUNTERS THAT MAY OCCUR. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

However, I'm committed to "building in public" – so while you can't take this software for a joyride without me, you're welcome to follow along on my journey! Feel free to peek over my shoulder, ask questions, and share in the excitement.

If you're dying to use this software for something other than ogling at my genius, shoot me a message. Let's chat over a cup of virtual coffee and see if we can make some magic happen.

For inquiries, compliments, or quirky anecdotes, reach out to the whimsical wizard behind this software.
